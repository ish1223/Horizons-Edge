# Horizons-Edge
This is my fully original 2D platformer game called Horizon's Edge. This repository includes all code and art files as well as prototype images that were used throughout the development process, with the main game code being the "final project main code.py" file, which should be run to play the game.

The game is a 2D platformer, where you play as a character whose goal is to eliminate all enemies in the level with your sword in order to win. You lose if you are hit 3 times by enemies. The game also features a pet wizard cat, which provides you with a teleport ability: by pressing the "E" key, the ability is used and you will be teleported to the position of your cursor/crosshair. The ability then goes on cooldown and cannot be used again until recharged.

There are some unfinished features, such as the secondary shotgun weapon which is not functional, however the design and movement for the weapon was still implemented.

The main aim is to eliminate all enemies without being eliminated yourself.
